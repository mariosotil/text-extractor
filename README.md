# text-extractor
Extracts text from Office and PDFs files, using POI and PDFBox, as a very, very tiny alternative to Tika

This library, obviously, NO replaces Tika. Only extracts text from Word, Excel, RTF and PDF files. It's based on the code found on https://codezrule.wordpress.com/2010/03/24/extract-text-from-pdf-office-files-doc-ppt-xls-open-office-files-rtf-and-textplain-files-in-java/  but using the last Apache POI and Apache PDFBox versions (04/30/2015).

- org.apache.poi, 3.11
- org.apache.pdfbox, 1.8.9
